      "I received my Patagonia jacket as a birthday gift and I love it! I wear it year-round and in all weather conditions â€“ I have it on as I'm writing this right now. I love the colors, the style, and the fit. It's an excellent jacket and I can't imagine wearing anything else.",

      "This jacket is exactly what I needed! I live in Texas, and get around a lot in the heat. I'm not usually a fan of jackets, but I purchased this one a few weeks ago and I love it. It's very warm and comfy, and I can wear it all day without overheating. The only negative is that it doesn't come with a rain cover, but that's just a minor fault.",

      "Hands down my favorite winter jacket! Super warm and comfortable. Typically I wear a size large but because it is a parka, I went a size down and it fits perfect. I really wish Patagonia would make this jacket in Navy Blue or Dark Gray",

      "Due to the time of year, I havent fully tested this jacket yet, but I will do so this winter. It did a great job keeping me warm during an April blizzard and during a cold Rocky Mountain evening. The fit is comfortable and the jacket is light, and I feel warm without feeling hot because it breathes so well.",
